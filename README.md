This tool gives users the ability to take a screenshot and read the text content of the screenshot. Works on Windows, macOS, and most modern Linux distros.

## Use

Running `textshot.py` with `python`/`python3` will open an overlay over the screen, where a rectangle can be drawn over the portion of the screen containing the text the user wishes to copy.

An optional command line argument can specify the language. For example, `python textshot.py eng+fra` will use English as the primary language and French as the secondary language. The default is `eng` (English). Make sure that the appropriate data files for Tesseract are installed for other languages. A list of all supported languages can be found [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/doc/tesseract.1.asc#languages-and-scripts).

The default language for the text-to-speech function is 'en' (English). 

It is recommended to attach a global hotkey to this tool so you can run it without opening a console and typing in the command.

On **Windows**, one can accomplish this by using an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script; `textshot.ahk` contains a sample AHK script that can be used.  
On **Ubuntu**, open the Keyboard Settings, which shows you all the Gnome shortcuts. At the bottom there is a `+` button to add your own shortcuts. Click it and set the command to `/usr/bin/python3 <path-to-textshot.py>`. In case you are using a virtual environment, the `python3` path above should point to the environment's `python3` instead of the global `python3`.  
The process on other operating systems can be found by searching how to run a shell command with a keyboard shortcut.

## Installation

- Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Clone this repository... `git clone https://github.com/ianzhao05/textshot.git`
- ...and `cd` into it `cd textshot`
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment, for example with `python -m venv .venv`, and activate it
- Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install [Google's Tesseract OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), and ensure that `tesseract` can be reached from the command line by adding the directory to your system path.
- `python textshot.py`

**Mac users:** You may need to give permission to capture the screen. You can do so by going to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording, then checking the box for Terminal/iTerm.  
**Linux users:** If the text shows up correctly in the notification, but you cannot paste it, install `xclip` (e.g. with `sudo apt install xclip`).

@rigred has added this to the AUR, so Arch Linux users can install the package `textshot-git` with their AUR helper. For example, `yay -S textshot-git`. This may not be up to date, so if you encounter issues, use the normal installation method above.
